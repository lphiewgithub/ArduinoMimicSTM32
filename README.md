# ArduinoMimicSTM32
## BasicToolsDemoCode

A lightweight, Arduino-inspired utility library for STM32 microcontrollers with professional-grade timing precision and communication capabilities.

### Description

This repository demonstrates a production-ready implementation of BasicTools, an embedded utility library that bridges the gap between Arduino simplicity and professional embedded development. The code showcases a robust approach to common microcontroller tasks with optimized performance and low overhead.

### Key Features

- **High-precision timing** - Microsecond-accurate time measurement using optimized SysTick handling with pre-computed divisors
- **Dual-protocol communication** - Seamless data exchange between USB CDC and UART interfaces with consistent API
- **Intelligent buffer management** - Implements receive timeout detection for complete message handling
- **HAL integration** - Works alongside STM32 HAL without modification while extending functionality
- **DMA-accelerated transfers** - Leverages hardware DMA for efficient data movement with proper state management

### Implementation Notes

The demo implements a bidirectional communication gateway between USB CDC and two UART ports, demonstrating timing-based packet detection and throughput optimization. The `micros()` implementation uses SysTick counter value manipulation to achieve microsecond precision without compromising MCU performance.

Designed specifically for STM32 microcontrollers running at 72MHz, the library abstracts hardware complexities while maintaining direct register access when needed for optimal performance.

### Target Applications

- Data acquisition systems requiring precise timestamping
- Protocol bridges and converters
- Diagnostic tools and test equipment
- Educational platforms for embedded systems

This code serves as both a functional example and a template for embedded systems requiring reliable communication with deterministic timing characteristics.
